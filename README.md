Steam Deck Emulation From Scratch

# Warning!!!
This is a personal passion project after getting frustrated with EmuDeck and RetroDeck either being opaque, overly complex, or blocking my ability to modify the configuration of emulators (namely RetroArch).  

This may eventually be 'stable' but until this Warning is removed - it's going to get a lot of, potentally breaking, updates

# About
This is an alternative to install and manage emulators, configs, and data rescoures on the Steam Deck using the applications from the native 'Discover' application on the Steam Deck.  

This should in theory be compatible with any other FlatPak Linux disto, but development will be talored to the Steam Deck.

# What it should do
- Install FlatPak versions of each emulator (exact list pending) from the SD flatpak CLI
- Link the imprtant data folders for each emulator to a common location (e.g. saves, screenshots, ect.)
- Install a default config file for the controls and semi-good visual settings
- Set any permissions on the 

# What is should NOT do
- Prevent users from modifying their configurations of each emulator
- Delete anything
